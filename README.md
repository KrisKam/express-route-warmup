Instructions:


I've given you a blank app.js, a package.json, and a data.js file
You will need to install your dependancies, then write your server code in the app.js
You will write two different routes, one to get all of the data, and one to get ONE piece of data by the id
For the base get route, ('/'), you will to return all the data in data.js
For the get by id route, ('/:id'), you will to return the piece of data that matches the id passed in the url
Google will be your friend
After we get this up and running, we'll deploy to heroku together.
